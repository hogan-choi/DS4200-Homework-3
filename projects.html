                <p> In this project, I tried to replicate popular Optical Character Recognition (OCR) packages (EasyOCR and Keras OCR) 
                    using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The custom made model has an 87.80% accuracy with predicting case sensitive 
                    characters and a 93.48% accuracy for case insensitive characters.

                <p> In this project, I aimed to re-create the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models proposed in the paper 
                    "(Re-)Imag(in)ing Price Trends" by Jiang, Kelly, and Xiu. This paper approaches trend-based predictability 
                    in stock prices by training CNN models to learn the price patterns in OHLC graphs.

                <p> In this project, I created different algorithms that users can use to draw various fractal shapes. These fractal 
                    shapes include: Canopy, Sierpinski's Triangle, Koch Curve, and Mandelbrot. Users can interact with a Python console
                    to draw and save different fractal shapes.

                <p> In our project, we aimed to create a GIMP-like application that allows users to easily add and edit images. These functions
                    include: setting filters on images, overlapping multiple images, loading custom projects, and saving images as jpg, png, or 
                    ppm files.

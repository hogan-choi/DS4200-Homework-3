                <p class="about_me">
                    Hello, my name is <b>Hogan Choi</b>! I'm currently a fourth year at Northeastern University studying Data Science and Mathematics. I have a 
                    strong passion for applying mathematical concepts to solve or understand real world phenomenas. Outside of academics and work, I enjoy participating
                    in various sports and extracurricular activities.
                    <br><br>
                    As of right now, I’m very interested in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). This is because this field is a perfect combination of Data Science and Mathematics. 
                    The fundamental principles of DNNs are based on matrix computation, calculus, linear algebra, and statistics. However, transferring these techniques to a 
                    computer and applying them to real world data requires in-depth knowledge in Data Science. Currently, variations of DNNs (CNNs, RNNs, LLMs, etc) have been 
                    very popular due to their high performance in data analysis and applications to real world scenarios. Hence, I would really love to pursue a career in that 
                    major. 
                    <br><br>
                    However, an important part in DNNs is visualizing the output of the model. This is crucial since it helps users understand and evaluate a model’s performance. 
                    For example, creating a line plot to keep track of accuracy is a great way to know how many iterations of training a model need. Furthermore, applying the model 
                    can also help analyze and find patterns in data, which need to be represented visually for people to intuitively understand.
